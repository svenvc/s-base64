# S-BASE64

## A Common Lisp implementation of Base64 Encoding/Decoding

`S-BASE64` is an open source Common Lisp implementation of Base64 encoding and decoding. Base64 encoding is a technique to encode binary data in a portable, safe printable, 7-bit ASCII format. For a general introduction, please consult the [Wikipedia article on
Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64). 

This simple package is used as a building block in a number of other open source projects e.g. the [KPAX](https://github.com/svenvc/KPAX) web development framework.

### Features

`S-BASE64` can:

-   convert a Base64 encoded character input stream into a decoded
    binary output stream
-   convert a binary output stream into a Base64 encoded character
    output stream
-   convert a Base64 encoded character input stream into a byte array
-   convert a byte array into a Base64 encoded character output stream
-   optionally break lines at 76 characters

### Status

`S-BASE64` is considered stable code.

### News

*October 2005* - Created as a separate project.

### Platforms

`S-BASE64` is written in ANSI standard Common Lisp and should be portable
across any CL implementation.

### Installation

The `S-BASE64 package` is loaded using [ASDF](http://www.cliki.net/asdf).
There is an excellent [tutorial on
ASDF](http://constantly.at/lisp/asdf/) to get you started.

    $ cd apps/asdf/systems/
    $ ln -s ~/darcs/s-base64/s-base64.asd .
    $ cd ~

### Usage

To encode you start with either a binary input stream or a byte array
and write to a character output stream. To decode you start from a
character input stream and write to a binary output stream or return a
byte array. You can use the standard CL marcros `WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING` of
`WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING` to convert to and from a string. The following
listener transcript show how to compute the second example from RFC
3548, section 7:

    CL-USER 1 > (in-package :s-base64)
    #<The S-BASE64 package, 50/128 internal, 4/16 external>

    S-BASE64 2 > (setf bytes #(#x14 #xfb #x9c #x03 #xd9))
    #(20 251 156 3 217)

    S-BASE64 3 > (with-output-to-string (out) 
                   (encode-base64-bytes bytes out))
    "FPucA9k="

    S-BASE64 4 > (with-input-from-string (in *)
                   (decode-base64-bytes in))
    #(20 251 156 3 217)

### API Reference

There is automatically generated API Referencedocumentation
available for the `S-BASE64` package in `doc/API.html`.

### Mailinglist

The [KPAX mailing
list](http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/kpax-devel) is
used for this project.

### Changelog

Release Notes:

-   release 1: moved `S-BASE64` into a seperate project under a new
    structure

### TODO

There is a variant of Base64 encoding used for URL's and filenames that
could be implemented.

### FAQ

Nothing appropriate.

### Bugs

Illegal input results in generic low-level CL conditions rather than a
more meaningful high-level application specific condition.

### Authors

`S-BASE64` was written by Sven Van
Caekenberghe.

### Maintainers

`S-BASE64` is being maintained by Sven Van
Caekenberghe.
